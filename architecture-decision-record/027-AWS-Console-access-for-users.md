# 27 AWS Console access for users

Date: 2021-11-03

## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Proposal

Give users (developers in service teams) access to the AWS Console of the Cloud Platform AWS account, so they could view their team's resources.

Implementation:

* AWS resources are tagged by the k8s namespace name, to which they are attached (simply added into our Terraform modules)
* Users would sign into the console using AWS SSO
* CP would set-up authorization in [ABAC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/abac-checklist.html), to give users access to their team's resources. Specifically it connects the user's GitHub team(s) with resource tags, using the mappings in the environment repo.

This would give teams console access to their backing resources, including RDS database, ECR, S3, etc.

TODO decide if they are somehow allowed write access - see discussion below.

Note: they would not have access to platform infrastructure, including the cluster which runs their containers, or the NLB where their user traffic ingresses. These are shared resources.

## Context

A key value of CP is to support teams to use **infrastructure as code**, rather than **ClickOps**.
IaC benefits:

* Infrastructure that you tested in the dev environment is going to be exactly the same in production. Whereas ClickOps risks deploying something different
* You can recreate infrastructure from scratch, confident their config is correct. Otherwise you gradually find yourself with 'configuration drift', meaning it is 'snowflake infrastructure', which you cannot risk recreating or recover from failure

With this in mind, CP has been designed so that users define their AWS resources in terraform. This pushes them to use the best practice of 'infrastructure as code', and they are supported in that practice, because CP team writes and maintains most of the terraform modules that they call, and maintain the CI/CD to apply it.

## User needs

Users have a number of uses for console access.

Use cases benefiting from **read-only** access to **their AWS resources**:

* **Learning and understanding** - The console is much more user-friendly than terraform (or the CLI/API). This is good for understanding what is configured, learning about configuration options, and generally learning AWS/cloud. The console communicates a lot about how the options fit together, current state and show  guidance and warnings, so are great for building a mental model of a service. Tutorials from AWS, CloudGuru, etc use the console, for even the most advanced services, so using the console to learn is a strong convention.
* **Visual feedback** - During usage, some services have state that is particularly useful to view in the console - RDS Performance Insights and Step Functions provide information in a very visually intensive way, and it is unreasonable to try and get the same experience via CLI or API.

Use cases that would need **read-only** access to **platform infrastructure**:

* **CP understanding** - Users benefit from seeing behind the CP interfaces, to see how the platform works. Reasoning:
    * for interests sake and their learning of cloud
    * knowing how something works enables you to use it better
    * so that they can evaluate it better from a security point of view, seeing the config of VPC, security groups, etc, and the console is how they are used to viewing this things

Use cases that would need **write** access to **their AWS resources**:

* **Quick iteration** when you're still trying stuff out or getting something to work, e.g. changing a port number
* **One-off operations**, such as upgrading a database version, triggering a database snapshot or restore

These use cases have been collected by chats with users and TA thoughts, and would benefit from proper user research.

## Write access

If giving users write access to the console, the concern would be not to allow long-lasting configuration changes.

Perhaps a solution would be:

* quick iterations would be allowed, as long as there is an understanding that at the end of the day or week it will be automatically reverted to what the terraform has configured
* one-off actions could maybe be identified and allowed
