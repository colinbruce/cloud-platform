# Add Concourse to a test cluster

## Pre-requisites

- A [test cluster][create-test-cluster]. For this guide, we'll assume it's called `david-test1`
- You must have [fly] installed

## Process

- Go through the installation procedure in the README.md file of the [concourse repo]
- Create a branch of the [concourse repo]
- Create a directory for your pipelines

```
mkdir -p pipelines/david-test1/main
```

- Copy an existing pipeline

e.g.

```
cp pipelines/manager/main/reporting.yaml pipelines/david-test1/main/
```

- Edit the pipeline yaml file as required (you probably want to remove everything relating to Pingdom)

- Login via `fly`

```
fly --target david-test1 login \
    --team-name main \
    --concourse-url https://concourse.apps.david-test1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
```

- Apply your pipeline

```
fly --target david-test1 set-pipeline \
    --pipeline plan-pipeline \
    --config pipelines/david-test1/main/plan-environments.yaml
```

Repeat this command whenever you make changes to the pipeline yaml file.

- Set up secrets

If your pipeline requires secrets, such as AWS credentials, you need to define those as kubernetes secrets in the `concourse-main` namespace (or `concourse-<team name>` if you're using a different concourse team, rather than `main`)
