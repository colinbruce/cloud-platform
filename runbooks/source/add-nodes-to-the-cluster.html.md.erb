# Add nodes to the cluster

This runbook covers how to increase the number of nodes in a Kops Kubernetes cluster.

In the steps below, we assume we want to increase the number of nodes in Live-1, from 27 to 30.

### Requirements

#### 1. Ensure you have access to the Cloud Platform AWS account

#### 2. Set your environment variables :

    export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://cloud-platform-kops-state
    export AWS_PROFILE=moj-cp

#### 3. Start a shell in the tools image

This will ensure you have the right versions of everything

    cd cloud-platform-infrastructure
    make tools-shell

#### 4. Be authenticated to the cluster :

    kops export kubecfg live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk

### Inline edit

Once authenticated to the cluster

```
bash-5.0# kops get instancegroup
Using cluster from kubectl context: live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk

NAME                                    ROLE    MACHINETYPE     MIN     MAX     ZONES
2xlarge-nodes-1.17.12                   Node    r5.2xlarge      2       2       eu-west-2b
ingress-nodes-1.17.12-eu-west-2a        Node    c5.xlarge       1       1       eu-west-2a
ingress-nodes-1.17.12-eu-west-2b        Node    c5.xlarge       1       1       eu-west-2b
ingress-nodes-1.17.12-eu-west-2c        Node    c5.xlarge       1       1       eu-west-2c
master-eu-west-2a                       Master  c5.4xlarge      1       1       eu-west-2a
master-eu-west-2b                       Master  c5.4xlarge      1       1       eu-west-2b
master-eu-west-2c                       Master  c5.4xlarge      1       1       eu-west-2c
nodes-1.17.12-eu-west-2a                Node    r5.xlarge       9       9       eu-west-2a
nodes-1.17.12-eu-west-2b                Node    r5.xlarge       9       9       eu-west-2b
nodes-1.17.12-eu-west-2c                Node    r5.xlarge       9       9       eu-west-2c
```

The 3 main worker node groups are `nodes-1.17.12-eu-west-2*`. To increase the worker node count to 30, you need to add 1 to each of those groups.

Do an inline edit for each group, and set `minSize` and `maxSize` to the same value, the increased number of nodes.

    bash-5.0# kops edit instancegroup nodes-1.17.12-eu-west-2a
    spec:
        ...
        maxSize: 10
        minSize: 10
        ...

Repeat for the `2b` and `2c` instancegroups.

Before we apply the changes, kops allows us to confirm what is going to happen:

    % kops update cluster
    Will modify resources:
    AutoscalingGroup/nodes-1.17.12-eu-west-2a.live-1.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk
        MaxSize             	 9 -> 10
        MinSize             	 9 -> 10
    ...

`THESE SHOULD BE THE ONLY CHANGES THAT YOU SEE, IF YOU SEE ANYTHING MORE: ABORT`

> If you need to abort, overwrite the kops state on S3 with the unchanged YAML file in the repo [like this](/running-kops-update-rollingupdate.html#updating-the-remote-kops-state)

If happy with the information above, the changes can be applied with:

    % kops update cluster --yes

Change progress can be monitored with:

    % kops validate cluster


### Persisting the changes

In order to ensure that the new configuration does not get overwritten at the next `kops update`, we need to persist those changes in the code.

#### 1. Create a new branch of the [cloud-platform-infrastructure ](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-infrastructure) repo

#### 2. In /terraform/cloud-platform/variables.tf, modify the `cluster_node_count_*` variables

```
variable "cluster_node_count_a" {
  description = "The number of worker node in the cluster in Availability Zone eu-west-2a"
  default = {
    live-1  = "10"
    default = "1"
  }
}
```

Make the same change for `cluster_node_count_b` and `cluster_node_count_c`.

#### 3. Push, Review, Merge

Once the PR is merged and a `terraform apply` is run, the `cloud-platform-infrastructure/kops/live-1.yaml` will be updated with the new size.

The updated `kops/live-1.yaml` file should also be committed to the repository, in a second PR.

For more information on `kops update` & `kops rolling-updtae`, have a look at this [runbook](https://runbooks.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/running-kops-update-rollingupdate.html#running-kops-update-and-rollingupdate).
